# Twitter Scraper

Golang implementation of python library <https://github.com/kennethreitz/twitter-scraper>

Twitter's API is annoying to work with, and has lots of limitations â€”
luckily their frontend (JavaScript) has it's own API, which I reverse-engineered.
No API rate limits. No tokens needed. No restrictions. Extremely fast.

You can use this library to get the text of any user's Tweets trivially.

## Usage

```golang
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    twitterscraper "github.com/n0madic/twitter-scraper"
)

func main() {
    for tweet := range twitterscraper.GetTweets("kennethreitz", 25) {
        fmt.Println(tweet.HTML)
    }
}
```

It appears you can ask for up to 25 pages of tweets reliably (~486 tweets).

## Installation

```shell
go get -u github.com/n0madic/twitter-scraper
```
